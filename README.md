__Note from Forker (Jus de Patate) :__
My objective is to make a bash version of sherlock, I'm not a bash pro so pull requests are ok ;)
[~~My objective is also to add some services like Star Citizen and EVE Online~~](https://github.com/TheYahya/sherlock/pull/123)

(also this screenshot **will** be the output of the final version, but for now it is the one from the original sherlock)
